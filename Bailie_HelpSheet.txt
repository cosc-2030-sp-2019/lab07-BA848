	What kind of file has extention ".md"? 
		An MD file is a text file created using one of several possible dialects of the Markdown language. 
		It is saved in plain text format but includes inline text symbols that define how to format the text 
		(e.g., bold, indentations, headers, table formatting).

(Lab02)How to Create an Object of type T and its Pointer?
	When you create the node you are essentially creating its pointer at the same time.

(Lab03)List the Python modules that you have imported in your Python experience, and what they contain. 
		only used the operator module
		

	And answer this question: What is the class of the ops variable? 
		operator

	(Review Ch. 5 of the Tutorial.) And what are the other general-purpose built-in container data structures in Python?
		list (as stacks and queues)
		Tuples and Sequences

(Lab04) How to declare a "record" structure in C++. (reference to juniata.edu)
	C++ Records, aka structs, 
	Record - a linear, direct-access data structure with heterogeneous components. 
	Field or member - component of the record; each field has its own type. 
	FieldName - the identifier used to refer to the field.
	Records are implemented as classes in C++. 
	
(Lab05) Write down how to declare a binary tree (using the identfier "root" "left node" and "right node" and containing a datum) in both C++ and Python.	
	C++: to declare a binary tree I would have a struct defined as a node
		example of struct
			struct node //(attribution https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/lesson18.html)
			{
			   int key_value;
			   node *left;
			   node *right;
			}

	Python: to declare a binary tree I would create a Node class where I assign a value to the node which produces a tree with
		only a root node and I can edit the code to insert nodes in the future.	
			example of Node Class
			class Node: #(attribution https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_binary_tree.htm)
			
				def _init_(self, data):
				
					self.left = None
					self.right = None
					self.data = data

				def PrintTree(self):
					print(self.data)

			root = Node(13)
			root.PrintTree()
			#when I execute the code there result is 13 because there is only one node(the root node)
				
(Lab06) How do you declare a class in Python?	
		class: blueprint created by programmer for an object defining a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is instantiated from the class
		object: instance of a class or the realized version of the class, where a class is manifested in the program 
		   (attribution: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-construct-classes-and-define-objects-in-python-3)
		
		use class as keyword to define class and def as keyword to define functions of the class
		example of the class Dog: (detailed beyond just the class for future reference)
			class Dog:
				def __init__(self, name):
					self.name = name
				def fetch(self):
					print(self.name + " is playing fetch.")
				def sleep(self):
					print(self.name + " is sleeping.")
			def main():
				rueger = Dog("Rueger")
				rueger.fetch()
				boss = Dog("Boss Dog")
				boss.sleep()
			if __name__ == "__main__":
				main()

			#output of code execution 
				Rueger is playing fetch.
				Boss Dog is sleeping. 

(Lab07) What is the drawback for the great speed of this type of data structure? (bit array) 
		Space is a drawback of bit arrays because you need one more position in the array than that of the largest value in the array. 
		Therefore, if you have a set consisting of 2,3,4,10^24 you will need 10^24 + 1 positions of space created in order to store 4 values. 
		Now thats just silly and inefficient.
