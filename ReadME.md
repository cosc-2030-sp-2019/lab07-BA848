Name some of the sorting algorithms you have studied and give their WORST CASE time complexity.

bubble sort- every element is compared to next element and if wrong possision they are swapped, simplest sorting algorithm. Worst case time complexity -> O(n^2)
selection sort- dividing array and sorting using both sides. used, but haven't had a lot of experience with. Worst Case time complexity -> O(n^2) (actually best case as well)
insertion sort- divide array, with every iteration we place 1st element of unsorted array in correct postion of sorted increasing the sorted list by one. Worst case -> O(n^2)

seems to be a pattern of worst case time complexity being overall O(n^2).
